# Logic for Communist AI on how to deal in peace conferences
# Should favor annexing other nations and taking their states
# Written by Henrik "Groogy" Hansson

#Adjustments
#The generic communist AI will very strongly prefer establishing puppet states and liberation, annexing only if they have a valid war goal.
#Communists will not expand overseas/into islands unless they have a core, preferring satellites instead.
#Soviet Union should/will have its own AI.
